# Image Captcha Font

This project is a font specifically designed for image captchas, aiming to improve the problem of difficult recognition caused by confusing letters and numbers. In particular, it optimizes characters such as z/Z, 0/o/O, s/S that are commonly confused in other regular fonts to provide better distinguishability.

## Key Features

- Improved distinction between z/Z: Carefully designed to ensure clear visual differences between z and Z, reducing misidentification.
- Differentiation of 0 and o/O: Utilizes different shapes and lines to differentiate these characters, ensuring clarity even at small sizes.
- Clear distinction between s and S: Emphasizes the differences between s and S through specific contour styles while eliminating similarities.
- etc.

## Use Cases

This image captcha font can be widely used in systems that require image verification to prevent malicious bots or automated attacks. Here are some typical use cases:

1. User registration pages: Ensures only real users can successfully register accounts while reducing spam registrations.
2. Login pages: Prevents brute-force password cracking and other login security risks.
3. Password recovery pages: Adds an additional layer of security to avoid unauthorized password resets.
4. Protection against automated malicious attacks: Safeguards online voting systems, comment sections, etc., which are prone to abuse by bots.
